      <strong>Who am I?</strong></br>
      I'm Madhuri, an engineering graduate from a city called Bangalore in India. 
      I obtained my engineering degree in Instrumentation and Electronics and worked 
      as a project coordinator for a multimedia company for 4.5 years. 
      Although I have worked in a managerial role, there has been this wish to dive into the world of 
      Software development. Fast forward to my move to Sweden earlier this year to live with my partner,
       it felt like the perfect time to finally give my IT dreams a shot. </br>

      In addition to my professional pursuits, my recent pastime has been cooking, learning the Swedish language,
      and exploring Sweden, and Iâ€™ve been loving it to every bit. </br></br>

      
      <strong>Why I want to learn "Tech for women" course?</strong> </br>
      After moving to Sweden, I started learning coding on my own while also simultaneously looking for a job in project coordination. However, I found myself enjoying the creative process of programming more. I began learning HTML and CSS by watching online tutorials to get the hang of things. That's when I developed an interest in front-end development. </br>

      It's been a good journey so far, but I've realized I need a bit more structured learning with a teacher, and that's where the "Women for IT" course caught my eye. It seems like a logical step, a roadmap to guide me through the courses. And I'm also excited about the chance to collaborate with other women who share the same enthusiasm.
      
 </br></br>

      <strong>What makes me tick as a future developer?</strong> </br>
      I enjoy working on designs and building things. With the few lines of code that I have
      learned online, I was able to write a personal blog. Though it looks a bit
      basic, seeing my ideas come to life was very satisfying. It's not just the
      technical know-how; it's the genuine enjoyment I find in the creative
      process of coding. </br></br>

      In closing, I bring a mix of solid skills, a hunger to learn, and a
      newfound passion for front-end development. The chance to contribute
      meaningfully and learn from a diverse community at your institution is
      what excites me the most. </br></br>

      Thank you :)

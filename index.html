      Hej! I'm Madhuri, and I've recently moved to Sweden. Back in India, I earned a
      Bachelor's in Engineering, majoring in Instrumentation and Electronics.
      For almost five years, I took on the role of a project coordinator, but
      there was always this wish to dive into the world of computer science.<br /></br>

      Fast forward to my move to Sweden earlier this year to be with my partner.
      It felt like the perfect time to finally give my IT dreams a shot. I
      started learning HTML and CSS on my own, watching online tutorials to get
      the hang of things. That's when I found an interest in Front-end
      development.<br /></br>

      It's been a good journey so far, but I've realized I need a bit more
      structure, and that's where the "Women for IT" course caught my eye. It
      seems like a logical step, a roadmap to guide me through the courses. I
      need that structured learning environment with a teacher and I'm stoked about the chance
      to collaborate with other women who share the same enthusiasm. <br /></br>

      <em>What makes me tick as a future developer?</em> I enjoy working
      on designs and building things. With the few lines of code that I have
      learned online, I was able to write a personal blog. Though it looks a bit
      basic, seeing my ideas come to life was very satisfying. It's not just the
      technical know-how; it's the genuine enjoyment I find in the creative
      process of coding. <br /></br>

      In closing, I bring a mix of solid skills, a hunger to learn, and a
      newfound passion for front-end development. The chance to contribute
      meaningfully and learn from a diverse community at your institution is
      what excites me the most. </br></br>

      Thank you :)
